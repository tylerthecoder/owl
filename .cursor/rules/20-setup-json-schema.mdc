## setup.json Schema (all fields optional)

```json
{
  "name": "<setup-name>",
  "install": "install.sh",
  "links": [
    { "source_path": "local:path/to/file", "target_path": "~/.config/file", "root": false }
  ],
  "rc_scripts": [
    "common:rc/systemctl-aliases.sh",
    "local:rc.sh"
  ],
  "menu_scripts": [
    "local:scripts/emoji.sh",
    { "path": "common:menu-scripts/run-script.sh", "name": "Run Script" }
  ],
  "services": [
    { "path": "local:systemd/playerctld.service", "service_type": "User" }
  ],
  "dependencies": ["git", "zsh"]
}
```

### Notes

- `local:` resolves relative to this setup directory.
- `common:` resolves relative to the repo root (e.g., `common/...`).
- `~` is expanded; absolute paths are respected.
- Services support `User` and `System` scopes.
- Root setups (formerly nests) use the exact same file format.
