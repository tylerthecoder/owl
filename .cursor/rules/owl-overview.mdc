# Owl Workspace Overview

- Entry point: [src/main.rs](mdc:src/main.rs)
- Purpose: Manage modular dotfile setups (including root setups under `nests/`), link files, install dependencies, and manage services.

## Core Concepts

- Setup: A modular unit with optional fields in `setup.json` located at `setups/<name>/setup.json`. Root setups live at `nests/<name>/setup.json` and can declare other setups via `dependencies`.
- Validate-first pattern: Parse `SetupFileRaw` (optional fields), then validate/resolve into `Setup` and specific validated items. All operations run only on validated types.
- Path tokens:
  - `local:` → relative to the setup directory
  - `common:` → relative to the repo root under `common/<area>/...`
  - `~` expands to home; absolute paths pass through
- Menu scripts: Linked to `~/.config/owl/menu-scripts/` and surfaced via Omni-Menu.
- Services: Setups can declare systemd units to link under user or system scope.

## CLI

- `owl setup <name> link|install|systemd|info|edit|all [--shallow]`
- `owl nest ...` acts on the active root setup; `owl nest switch` selects it.
- `owl setups-validate` validates all setups and nests.

## Common Effects

- Link files (respecting tokens; ensure parent dirs exist).
- Link rc scripts into `~/.config/owl/rc/` with `rc-<setup>-<script>` naming.
- Link menu scripts into `~/.config/owl/menu-scripts/`.
- Link systemd unit files and enable/restart per scope (uses `--now`).
